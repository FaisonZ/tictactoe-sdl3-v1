# Tic Tac Toe Project

**Status**: Completed!

This was my first SDL3 project.

## My Goals

* Make tic-tac-toe as quick as possible
* Build against vendered SDL `so` files
* Bundle build into a distributable tar that can extract and run in place
  * So the SDL `so` files are used relatively from the binary
  * Only building and bundling for Linux for now

## Build

```bash
./bin/build.sh
```
